Summary : <br/>

<font size= "4" >
In this video, we take an in-depth look at CNNs and their role as powerful machine learning models for deep learning brain tumor classification tasks. 

We will explore how CNNs are transforming the landscape of brain tumor classification through deep learning algorithms. Witness the incredible accuracy achieved by AI in detecting brain tumors and its potential to revolutionize medical diagnosis and treatment.

<br/><br/> 
Look no further than this step-by-step tutorial! In this video, we will take you through the process of building and training a convolutional neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras. We will use a dataset of chess piece images to train the model and show you how to evaluate its performance. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to use the trained model to predict the class of a new brain image
