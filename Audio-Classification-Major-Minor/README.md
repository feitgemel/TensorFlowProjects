Discover how to classify audio chords with our latest YouTube tutorial!
<br/><br/> 
In our latest video tutorial, we will show you how to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify audio chords. 🎧🌈 

We will start by examining a few audio files and playing them back. Then, we will code a transform process to convert the audio files to spectrogram images. Spectrogram images are visual representations of sound waves. They can be used to identify different frequencies and amplitudes, which can be used to classify chords.

Next, we will write a CNN model to generate a binary classification between major and minor chords. We will train the model on a dataset of spectrogram images that have been labeled with the correct chord. The model will learn to identify the features of each chord and to classify them accordingly.
Finally, we will test the model on a new set of spectrogram images that have not been labeled. The model will predict the chord for each image and you can compare its predictions to the ground truth labels.

It is based on Tensorflow and keras.
