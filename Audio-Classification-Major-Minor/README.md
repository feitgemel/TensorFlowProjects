Are you interested in learning about how to use Convolutional Neural Networks in Python to predict chess pieces? 
<br/><br/> 
Look no further than this step-by-step tutorial! In this video, we will take you through the process of building and training a convolutional neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras. We will use a dataset of chess piece images to train the model and show you how to evaluate its performance. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to use the trained model to predict the class of a new chess piece image
<br/><br/> 
It is based on Tensorflow and keras.

You can find the link for the [tutorial](https://youtu.be/Y2MkEuZ3AEw) here. 

You can find more cool Tensorflow projects and tutorials in this [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkryDe59y4Ze9_12JhWu3cs-lOGYwYeD)

Enjoy
