<font size= "4" >
🦕 Welcome to our comprehensive Dinosaur Image Classification Tutorial! 🦖
<br/><br/> 
What You'll Learn:

🔹 Data Preparation: We'll begin by downloading a curated dataset of dinosaur images, neatly categorized into five distinct classes. You'll learn how to load and preprocess the data using Python, OpenCV, and Numpy, ensuring it's perfectly ready for training.

🔹 CNN Architecture: Unravel the secrets of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as we dive into their structure and discuss the different layers—convolutional, pooling, and fully connected. You'll gain a solid understanding of how these layers work together to extract meaningful features from images.

🔹 Model Training: Harness the power of Tensorflow and Keras to define and train our custom CNN model. We'll configure the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics to achieve optimal performance during training.

🔹 Evaluation Metrics: We'll thoroughly evaluate our trained model using various metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix to measure its efficiency and robustness.

🔹 Predicting New Images: Watch as we put our pre-trained model to the test! We'll showcase how to use the model to make predictions on fresh, unseen dinosaur images, and witness the magic of AI in action.
