Welcome to our 36 Fruits and Vegetables classification tutorial using TensorFlow, Keras and Python  
<br/><br/> 

🍏🥕🍅 In this tutorial, we guide you through the process of building a neural network capable of classifying 36 different fruits and vegetables using TensorFlow and Python. 🎥
📚 Here's what you'll learn: 

🔹 Data Preparation: Explore the dataset and learn how to preprocess and organize your image data effectively. 
🔹 Model Building: Construct a deep neural network with TensorFlow and Keras, layer by layer. 
🔹 Model Training: Witness the training process and fine-tuning for impressive accuracy. 
🔹 Model Evaluation: Assess how well the model performs on new, unseen data. 
🔹 Predictions: Discover the inner workings of the model as it makes predictions on individual images.
