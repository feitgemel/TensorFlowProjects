Welcome to our tutorial on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify retinal images into four distinct categories.
<br/><br/> 
In this step-by-step guide, you'll learn how to gather and preprocess a dataset of over 80,000 retinal images, design a powerful CNN architecture, and train a model that can accurately distinguish between these health categories.

🔥 What You'll Learn:

🔹 Data Collection and Preprocessing: Discover how to acquire and prepare retinal images for optimal model training. 

🔹 CNN Architecture Design: Create a customized architecture tailored to retinal image classification. 

🔹 Training Process: Explore the intricacies of model training, including parameter tuning and validation techniques. 

🔹Model Evaluation: Learn how to assess the performance of your trained CNN on a separate test dataset. 

<br/><br/> 
It is based on Tensorflow and keras.
