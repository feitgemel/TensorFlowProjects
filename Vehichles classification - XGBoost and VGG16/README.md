Summary : <br/>


<font size= "4" >
Welcome to our Vehicles classification based on Vgg16 and XGboost 
<br/><br/> 

The tutorial is divided into four parts:

🖼️ Part 1: We kick off by preparing our dataset, which consists of thousands of vehicle images across five categories. We demonstrate how to load and organize the training and validation data efficiently. 

🧠 Part 2: With our data in order, we delve into the feature extraction process using VGG16, a pre-trained convolutional neural network. We explain how to load the model, freeze its layers, and extract essential features from our images. These features will serve as the foundation for our classification model.

🚀 Part 3: The heart of our classification system lies in XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm. We walk you through the training process, from loading the extracted features to fitting our model to the data. By the end of this part, you'll have a finely-tuned XGBoost classifier ready for predictions.

🔮 Part 4: The moment of truth arrives as we put our classifier to the test. We load a test image, pass it through the VGG16 model to extract features, and then use our trained XGBoost model to predict the vehicle's category. You'll witness the prediction live on screen as we map the result back to a human-readable label.
