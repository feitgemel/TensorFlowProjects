Summary : <br/>


<font size= "4" >
This is a Tensorflow Hub tutorial that enables you to classify landmarks images using the pre-trained Tensorhub platform 
So what are the next steps ? how to use Tensorflow hub ? Follow this tutorial

<br/><br/> 

We will install the relevant Python libraries , then search for the right pre-trained model , and learn how you this CNN model to classify images in Europe.
