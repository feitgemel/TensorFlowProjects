Summary : <br/>


<font size= "4" >
In this video tutorial, you'll discover how to classify car images using computer vision and deep learning.
We'll be using Tensorflow and Keras to configure a Resnet50 model that can quickly and accurately classify car brands with transfer learning.  
<br/><br/> 
Whether you're interested in building your own image classification models or want to apply deep learning techniques to a variety of real-world problems, this tutorial is the perfect place to start !
