Summary : <br/>


<font size= "4" >
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use TensorFlow and Mobilenet to classify images through transfer learning. Transfer learning is a technique that allows you to take pre-trained models and adapt them to new use cases, making it an efficient way to build powerful image recognition systems.
<br/><br/> 
We'll start by installing the necessary Python libraries, and then walk you through the process of training a Mobilenet model to classify images. You'll learn how to preprocess the image data, fine-tune the model, and evaluate its performance using validation data. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use TensorFlow and Mobilenet for image classification, and be able to apply these techniques to your own image recognition projects. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this tutorial will give you the tools you need to build sophisticated image recognition systems with ease.
<br/><br/> 
It is based on Tensorflow and keras.
