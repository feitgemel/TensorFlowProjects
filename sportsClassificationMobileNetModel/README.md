<font size= "4" >
Welcome to our guide on Sports Image Classification using TensorFlow, Keras, and MobileNet! 🏆📸

<br/><br/> 
In this tutorial, You'll learn how to build an image classification model capable of recognizing 21 different sports, from basketball to weightlifting.

🔍 What's Covered in this Video: 🔍

📦 Dataset Download: We'll start by obtaining a large sports image dataset from Kaggle, carefully curated with 21 unique sports categories. 

🏋️‍♂️ Model Building: Using TensorFlow and Keras, we'll dive into the architecture of MobileNet, a pre-trained model. We'll then customize it for our specific classification task. 

🖼️ Data Preparation: Learn how to preprocess and organize your data into train, validation, and test sets, ensuring your model has a solid foundation to learn from. 

🧠 Model Training: We'll guide you through the process of training your model, fine-tuning it to achieve impressive accuracy. 

📊 Model Evaluation: Discover how to assess the performance of your sports image classifier and understand the results. 

📸 Real-World Predictions: Watch as we make predictions on new sports images, overlaying the predicted class for a real-world demonstration of our model in action.
