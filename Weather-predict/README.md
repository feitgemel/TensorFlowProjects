Summary : <br/>


<font size= "4" >
🌼 Welcome to artificial intelligence and weather image prediction tutorial ! 
In this tutorial, we dive deep into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and Keras to categorize weather patterns
We will also learn how to predict those images using fine-tuning of Vgg19 transfer learning  🌻. 

<br/><br/> 
🔍 Key Topics Covered:

🔹 Setting up a CNN model for image classification.

🔹 Utilizing TensorFlow and Keras for efficient deep learning.

🔹 Training the model with a diverse dataset of weather images (rainy, foggy, sunny, and more!).

🔹 Plotting the training outcome, and exploring the results.

🔹 Saving the best model for future predictions.

🔹 We will also learn a similar process of training based on transfer learning .


<br/><br/> 

We have two tutorial , so check these two links :
You can find the link for the CNN [tutorial](https://youtu.be/gFiISJPCpKs) here. 
The Transfer learning [tutorial](https://youtu.be/uw3WK0TcGH4) is in this second link.

You can find more cool Tensorflow projects and tutorials in this [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkryDe59y4Ze9_12JhWu3cs-lOGYwYeD)

Enjoy
