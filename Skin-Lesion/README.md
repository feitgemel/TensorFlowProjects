In our latest video tutorial, we will take you into the world of skin melanoma classification using CNN technology.

<br/><br/> 
🔬👩‍🔬 Throughout this tutorial, we will guide you through each essential step. 
We'll begin by diving into data preparation, where we will organize, clean, and prepare the data form the classification model.
<br/><br/> 
🌟💉 Next, we will walk you through the process of building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. We'll explain how to build the layers, and optimize the model.

Finally, we will test the model on a new fresh image and challenge our model.
