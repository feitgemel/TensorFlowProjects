Summary : <br/>

<font size= "4" >
🦕 Welcome to our dog breed recognition Tutorial, based on  the NasLarge pre-trained model 🦖
<br/><br/> 
What You'll Learn:

🔹 Data Preparation: We'll begin by downloading a curated dataset of dinosaur images, neatly categorized into five distinct classes. You'll learn how to load and preprocess the data using Python, OpenCV, and Numpy, ensuring it's perfectly ready for training.

🔹 CNN Architecture and Transfer learning : We will load the the NasLarge model , discuss how to customize it for our need and run the train on our own dataset. (80% validation)

🔹 Predicting New Images: Watch as we put our pre-trained model to the test! We'll showcase how to use the model to make predictions on fresh, unseen dogs images, and witness the results.


<br/><br/> 
It is based on Tensorflow and keras.
