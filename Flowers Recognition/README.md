Summary : <br/>


<font size= "4" >
🌼 In our latest video tutorial, we will dive into image classification using Python and TensorFlow.
Discover how to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 📊 that can identify various types of flowers 🌻. 

<br/><br/> 
What you'll learn:
•	Setting up your Python environment and TensorFlow.
•	Organizing your flower dataset for training and validation.
•	Data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
•	Constructing a CNN architecture.
•	Training the model and monitoring its accuracy and loss.
•	Saving and loading your trained model for future use.
