<font size= "4" >
Welcome to our Animals Image Segmentation with U-Net and TensorFlow Keras 
<br/><br/> 

The tutorial is divided into four parts:

🖼️ Part 1: Data Preparation We kick things off by downloading and preparing the dataset. Get ready to learn how to load images and masks, preprocess them for model training, and set the stage for building our U-Net model.

🧠 Part 2: Building the U-Net Model Uncover the architecture that powers accurate image segmentation – U-Net. We'll walk you through the construction of an encoder-decoder model, complete with convolutional layers, batch normalization, and more.

🚀 Part 3: Training the U-Net Model Witness the magic unfold as we train our U-Net model. We'll compile the model, split the data for training and validation, and optimize the learning process using callbacks like checkpoints and early stopping.

🔮 Part 4: Testing and Visualization Time to put our U-Net model to the test! We'll load the trained model, predict on unseen images, and visualize the results. You'll discover how to interpret the predicted masks and extract the segmented objects.
