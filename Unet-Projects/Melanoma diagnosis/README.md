Summary : <br/>

<font size= "4" >
🩺 Welcome to our Melanoma Image Segmentation with U-Net and TensorFlow Keras 🔬
<br/><br/> 
The tutorial is divided into four parts:

Part 1: Data Preprocessing and Preparation
In this part, you load and preprocess the dataset, including resizing images and masks, converting masks to binary format, and splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets.


Part 2: U-Net Model Architecture
This part defines the U-Net model architecture using Keras. It includes building blocks for convolutional layers, constructing the encoder and decoder parts of the U-Net, and defining the final output layer.


Part 3: Model Training
Here, you load the preprocessed data and train the U-Net model. You compile the model, define training parameters like learning rate and batch size, and use callbacks for model checkpointing, learning rate reduction, and early stopping. The training history is also visualized.


Part 4: Model Evaluation and Inference
The final part demonstrates how to load the trained model, perform inference on a new Melanoma. We will predict the mask to detect Melanona and visualize the original image , the predicted mask , and the ground truth. Interesting !!!
