<font size= "4" >
Do you want to learn how to classify audio data using deep learning and TensorFlow Hub? 
<br/><br/> 
Check out our latest tutorial on Audio classification using deep learning and TensorFlow Hub! 
 <br/><br/> 
We'll walk you through the entire process step-by-step, from setting up your environment to training and testing your audio classifier.
<br/><br/> 
Tensorflow Hub has cool pre-trained models. 
Imagine you have a audio file , and you would like to detect if it is a sound of a cat , or the sounds of water , or maybe to classify music.
 <br/><br/> 
So, in this tutorial we will learn how to use this tensor hub model on your own audio files .
It is based on Tensorflow and keras.

You can find the link for the [tutorial](https://youtu.be/_iX0VRp7UEA) here. 

You can find more cool Tensorflow projects and tutorials in this [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkryDe59y4Ze9_12JhWu3cs-lOGYwYeD)

Enjoy
