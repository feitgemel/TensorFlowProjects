📹✨ Emotion Detection with Deep Learning! – Step by Step 🌟🔍💻
In our latest video tutorial, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of building an emotion detection model using deep learning and image classification techniques. 🤖📸
<br/><br/> 

During this tutorial, we will guide you through the essential stages, starting from preprocessing the data and designing the neural network architecture, to training the model effectively.
Next, we will demonstrate how to test the model on a fresh new image and accurately predict the emotion of the face.
