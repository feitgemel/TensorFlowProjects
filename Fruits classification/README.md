🍎🍌🍓 Calling all CNN and deep learning enthusiasts! 🍊🍇🍍
🚀 In this in-depth tutorial, we explain, step-by-step , the process of building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model tailored specifically for fruit classification. 🌱🍎

<br/><br/> 
The process will describe the model training, choosing the rights layers and filters, training , and running a fresh test image to check our result.
