Summary : <br/>


<font size= "4" >
Welcome to our comprehensive image classification tutorial series! In this tutorial playlist, consisting of five informative videos, we will guide you through the entire process of classifying monkey species in images. 
Each video focuses on a specific aspect of the process, providing you with a well-rounded understanding of the subject matter. 
Join us as we cover data preparation, classic CNN classification, hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner, fine-tuning a pretrained model (VGG16), 
and exploring the outcome of deep neural network layers. Get ready to dive into the world of monkey species classification and enhance your knowledge with practical examples and expert tips.

<br/><br/> 
🐒 Video 1: Data Preparation Tutorial:

In the first video of our series, we will walk you through the essential steps of data preparation for monkey species classification. 
Discover how to download the necessary image data and explore its characteristics. 
Learn how to preprocess and format the data to ensure it is ready for the subsequent phases of the classification process. 
By the end of this tutorial, you will have a well-prepared dataset, laying the foundation for accurate and efficient classification.
