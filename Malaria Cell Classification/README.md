Summary : <br/>


<font size= "4" >
Welcome to our tutorial on Malaria cell classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Python.  We will make it very simple to understand and process this classification 

<br/><br/> 

* Part 1: Data Preparation
In the first part, we'll guide you through the process of downloading the dataset and preparing it for training. We learn to prepare the data split the dataset for training and testing, and make all the relevant requirements needed for the training.

* Part 2: CNN Model Building and Training
The heart of this tutorial lies in Part 2, where we dive into building a simple CNN model. We will customize the model, define the layers , and train the model using the prepared data. We will save the best weights of the train process.

* Part 3: Model Testing and Prediction
In the final part, we'll put our trained model to the test. We'll take a fresh image that the model has never seen before and use it to demonstrate how our model can classify it as infected or non-infected.  
 
<br/><br/> 
It is based on Tensorflow and keras.
